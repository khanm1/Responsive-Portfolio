      <p>My name is Mohammad Khan, I grew up in Boston, MA. I'm originally from Dhaka, Bangladesh.
        I started working full time when I was 18 Year's old and I was going school full time. When I was 20 year's old
        I went to
        work for Boston Scientific Corp, I end up working for them 10 years. I moved to Chicago 2013 and I start
        working
        for Allstate Insurance Corp. Currently I'm a Sr. Test Engineer at Allstate.</p>

      <p>I'm a huge sports fan, Specially New England Patriot’s and Boston Red Sox fan.
        I enjoy reading books, specially non-fiction book. I'm very carefull about what I eat, I believe you are the
        product of what you eat. I try to work out every day and I make sure I’m going to gym at least five times a
        week.
        Work out is big part of my life.</p>
